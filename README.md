# GlutenFreeMap
Map of restaurants I have researched and deemed safe to eat at as a celiac
Categories
100% gluten free resturants
100% gluten free bakeries (a must for bakeries, I do not eat at shared facility bakeries)
AIC resturants (Italy celiac association approved resturants)
Shared facility resturants - these require additional research from me to approve, and I will attempt to include notes for further information on saftey procedures, etc. 
Gelato or other "specialty" options
